    * 1 if x==0.0
    * the sign of x otherwise

function qrH!(A::AbstractMatrix)
    """
    qrH!(A)
    
    Computes the Householder QR factorization so that no additional memory space is allocated beyond that already occupied by the full rank overdetermined input matrix A.
    
    Computes : A = QR
    
    Where :
        - Q is an unitary matrix (it means Q*Q = I)
        - R is upper triangular
    
    The strategy used here is first to overwrite the coefficients of R in the upper triangle of A. Besides, Q is defined only by vⱼ = A[j:m,j] (i.e. the elements of the jᵗʰ column of A beneath the diagonal), but the issue is only j-m elements can still be stored within A. That is why, those A[j:m,j] are scaled so that vⱼ[1] = 1. As we now know this information, there are j-m elements remaining in vⱼ that can be stored in A.

    #### Input arguments

    * `A`: a full rank matrix of dimension m × n, m ≥ n;

    #### Output arguments

    * `A`: a matrix of dimension m × n, m ≥ n, containing the coefficients of Q and R;
