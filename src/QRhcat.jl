    QRhcat!(A1::AbstractMatrix, A2::AbstractMatrix)

    Computes the QR-factorisation of an overdetermined full-rank (m × n) matrix A presented as a horizontally conctenated one, i.e. A = [A₁ A₂] where A₁ and A₂ are overdetermined full-rank matrices of dimension (m × n₁) and (m × n₂) respectively such that : n₁ + n₂ = n.

    Computes : A = QR

    Where :
        - Q is an unitary matrix (it means Q*Q = I)
        - R is upper triangular
    
    As A is seen as horizontally concatenated, we will first compute A₁ = Q₁R₁ to then calculate Q₁ᵀA₂ and compute afterward the dense QR factorization on the below block of Q₁ᵀA₂ (of dimension (m-n₁ × n₂)

    #### Input arguments

    * `A1` : a full-rank overdetermined matrix of dimension (m × n₁)
    * `A2` : a full-rank overdetermined matrix of dimension (m × n₂)

    #### Output arguments

    * `A1` : a full-rank overdetermined matrix of dimension (m × n₁), containing the coefficients of Q₁ and R₁
    * `A2` : a full-rank overdetermined matrix of dimension (m × n₂), modified such that A = QR
